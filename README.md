# DFA_Project

<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>This was the final project for my Theoretical Foundations class at Georgia Southern University.</p>
<p>My teammate for this project was Tyler Hodzen who's github page can be found <a href="https://github.com/thodzen">here</a></p>
<p>We were instructed to build a Deterministic finite automaton that could be created from a text file.</p>
<p>Since we were able to choose our method of creating the DFA and be creative with it, we choose to use C++.</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>When launching the program, you enter the file that contains the DFA and the string you wish to test as command line arguments.</p>
<p>After reading it, a window will appear showing you the DFA in action.</p>
<p>In order to test a different string or a different DFA, the program must be closed and relaunched with different command line arguments.</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Besides wanting a good grade, we choose C++ so that we could get better at the language.</p>
<p>This also benefited me since I was able to implement different rasterization methods.</p>
<p>I was able to write a method to draw a circle, load and draw text using a java program I wrote, and draw bezier curves.</p>
<p>These methods are not perfect in anyway as there are more efficient and accurate methods to do all of those, though I did learn how to implement them on a low level.</p>
